Welcome to the Simple Contribution project! ðŸŽ‰

Here is a step-by-step guide to making your first contribution to this project. If you're new to GitHub, this guide will help you understand the basics of contributing and getting involved in the open-source community.

### Step 1: Fork the repository

To make changes to this project, you first need to create your own copy by forking the repository. Simply click the **Fork** button at the top-right of this page.

### Step 2: Clone your fork

Once you have forked the repository, clone your fork to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-contribution.git
```

### Step 3: Add your details

* Open the cardDetails.json file in your code editor.
* Add a new entry to the JSON file with your details. Simply copy the format below and modify it with your own details:

```bash
{
  "name": "Your Name",
  "profession": "Your Profession",
  "quote": "\"Your favourite quote\" - Said by You",
  "github": "https://github.com/yourusername",
  "linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile",

```

Make sure you do not remove anyone else's detailsâ€”just add yours below the existing entries.

### Step 4: Commit your changes
After adding your details, you need to save the changes and commit them to your forked repository:

```bash
git add cardDetails.json
git commit -m "Added my details"
```

### Step 5 : Push your changes
